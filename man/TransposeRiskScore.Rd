\title{Transpose Risk Score}
\usage{
TransposeRiskScore(dfResults, dfMetrics, strValuesFrom = "flag_icon")
}
\arguments{
\item{dfResults}{`data.frame` The risk score data to be transposed. Should include columns such as `MetricID`, `Flag`, `RiskScore`, and grouping columns like `StudyID`, `SnapshotDate`, `GroupID`, `GroupLevel`.}

\item{dfMetrics}{`data.frame` The metrics reference table. Must include `MetricID` and `Abbreviation` (used as `MetricLabel`).}

\item{strValuesFrom}{`character` The column name from which to take values in the transposed data. (Currently not used, reserved for future flexibility.)}
}
\value{
`data.frame` The transposed risk score data with metric labels as column groups (Flag, RiskScore, Label for each metric).
}
\description{
Transposes the risk score data frame so that each metric (by `MetricID`) becomes a set of columns, structuring the data for reporting. Merges in metric labels from `dfMetrics` and creates a formatted label column. The result is a wide-format data frame suitable for reporting or visualization.
