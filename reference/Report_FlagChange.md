# Report Flag Changes

Generate an HTML summary of newly changed risk flags between snapshots.

## Usage

``` r
Report_FlagChange(dfResults)
```

## Arguments

- dfResults:

  A data.frame generated by gsm.reporting::CalculateChange(), containing
  both current and previous snapshot columns. Optionally, may include
  custom \`GroupLabel\` and \`MetricLabel\` columns for display.

## Value

HTML (character) containing a nested unordered list of newly changed
flags, grouped by absolute flag value and color-coded. Each entry
includes the flag transition, score/metric/numerator/denominator
changes, and snapshot details.

## Details

This function compares the current and previous snapshot for each
group/metric and lists all changes in flag status, including the
direction and magnitude of change. It provides a detailed breakdown for
each change, including the group, metric, flag transition, score and
metric changes, and numerator/denominator details. Optionally, if
\`GroupLabel\` or \`MetricLabel\` columns are present, they will be used
for display; otherwise, \`GroupID\` and \`MetricID\` are used.

\- Only rows where the flag value has changed (including NA transitions)
are included. - Rows where the flag went from NA to green (0) are
excluded. - Results are grouped and color-coded by the absolute value of
the new flag (red, amber, green). - For each change, the function
displays: - Group and metric (using labels if available) - Flag
transition (with icon) - Score and metric changes (\\\Delta\\ Score,
\\\Delta\\ Metric, etc.\`) - Previous and current snapshot details
(flag, score, rate, numerator/denominator)
