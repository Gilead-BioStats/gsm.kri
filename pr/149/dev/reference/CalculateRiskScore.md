# Calculate Risk Score

Calculates the risk score for each group in the provided results data
frame. The function aggregates weighted flag values across all metrics
for each group, creating a composite risk score as a percentage of the
total possible risk.

## Usage

``` r
CalculateRiskScore(dfResults, dfWeights, strMetricID = "Analysis_srs0001")
```

## Arguments

- dfResults:

  \`data.frame\` Dataframe of stacked analysis outputs from the metrics
  calculated in the \`workflow/2_metrics\` workflows. Must contain the
  columns \`GroupLevel\`, \`GroupID\`, \`MetricID\`, \`Flag\`.

- dfWeights:

  \`data.frame\` Dataframe with Risk score weight information, including
  \`MetricID\`, \`Flag\`, \`Weight\` and \`WeightMax\`. This data.frame
  can be created by stacking results from \`gsm.core::Flag()\` for all
  relevant KRIs, or by calling
  \`gsm.kri::MakeWeights(gsm.core::reportingMetrics)\`

- strMetricID:

  \`character\` The MetricID to assign to the calculated risk scores.
  Default is "Analysis_srs0001".

## Value

\`data.frame\` with risk score data containing columns: \`GroupLevel\`,
\`GroupID\`, \`MetricID\`, \`Numerator\` (sum of weights),
\`Denominator\` (sum of max weights across all metrics), \`Metric\`
(risk score percentage), \`Score\` (same as Metric), and \`Flag\` (set
to NA).

## Details

The function calculates risk scores by:

1.  Summing the \`Weight\` values for each group across all metrics

2.  Calculating a global denominator as the sum of \`WeightMax\` values
    across all unique metrics

3.  Computing the risk score as (Numerator / Denominator) \* 100

Risk scores represent the percentage of total possible risk that each
group exhibits, allowing for comparison across groups and identification
of high-risk sites or entities.

## Examples

``` r
# Prepare data with weights from gsm.core::reportingResults
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: ‘dplyr’
#> The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

# Filter to single study/snapshot and remove any existing risk scores
dfResults <- gsm.core::reportingResults %>%
  dplyr::filter(!grepl("srs0001", MetricID)) %>%
  FilterByLatestSnapshotDate()

# Create weights table
dfWeights <- gsm.kri::MakeWeights(gsm.core::reportingMetrics)

# Calculate risk scores
dfRiskScore <- CalculateRiskScore(dfResults, dfWeights)
#> Warning: Rows with NA values in 'Weight' or 'WeightMax' have been dropped, corresponding to thefollowing metric IDs:
#> - Analysis_kri0013.
