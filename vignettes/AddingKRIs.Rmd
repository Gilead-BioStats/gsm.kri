## Overview

This vignette outlines the necessary analytics tasks required before a new Key Risk Indicator (KRI), Quality Tolerance Limit (QTL), or similar metric can be put into production. Once a subject-level data listing is received from the source system and incorporated into our monthly snapshots, a structured workflow ensures seamless integration of the new metric. This process includes updates to the GSM data model, creation of a KRI workflow, qualification testing, and incorporation into reporting outputs. By following these steps, we maintain data integrity, ensure metric accuracy, and support risk signal generation and reporting functionalities. 


## Adding a new KRI Step-by-Step

Once a subject level data listing is provided from a source system and those tables have been added to our monthly snapshots, we have the following analytics tasks to complete before a new metric (KRI/QTL, etc) can be put in to production. 

1. Make needed updates to gsm data model
2. Create a KRI workflow
3. Add qualification test(s) ensuring that the metric is behaving as expected for test data.  
4. Steps to incorporate metric into optional reporting outputs
    - Add new metrics to apps/reports
    - Generate Risk signals for `{grail}`
    - Update existing Study scripts to add the metrics

Below we get into more detail for each of these steps

### Make updates to the gsm data model

For each KRI, there will be data requirements that need to be specified as the first step to incorporating the KRI into a final report. The first step in this process is to ensure that the data is programmatically available to be pulled down from a centralized data store. Once this is confirmed, an issue is to be filed in `{gsm.mapping}` repo using the `Add New Domain` issue template and filling in the relevant information.

With the issue filed, and the requirements laid out, a specification mapping file is created that indicates the name of each data source, and all required fields from each respective data source along with their data types. An example of this specification yaml file is below. More details about the construction of these files can be found in `{gsm.mapping}` package documentation.

```
meta:
  Type: Mapped
  ID: PD
  Description: Protocol Deviation Data Mapping 
  Priority: 1
spec: 
  Raw_PD:
    subjid:
      type: character
      source_col: subjectenrollmentnumber
    deemedimportant:
      type: character
steps:
  - output: Mapped_PD
    name: =
    params:
      lhs: Mapped_PD
      rhs: Raw_PD
```

It is possible that some of the domains that are needed for a given KRI may already be mapped in `{gsm.mapping}`. In this case, check the existing spec for that domain for all relevant fields, and if any are missing, create an issue to `Edit Existing Domain`, and fill in all fields. Once the edits have been made following the [Contributor Guidelines](), submit a Pull Request to merge in the edits required for adding this new KRI.

Add support for new tables in `gsm.datasim` for use in the gismo test environment.
  
### Creating a KRI Workflow

To implement a new Key Risk Indicator (KRI) within the system, we must establish workflows and update several existing analytical functions to align with the new requirements. This process ensures that the new KRI is accurately integrated into our analytics framework and reporting structure. A more in depth discussion of the Analytics pipeline is outlined in this [vignette](link to step-by-step analytics vignette in gsm.core)

#### Creating and Customizing YAML Workflow Files
The first step is to create or modify YAML workflow files that define the new KRI. These files include:

- **Metric Metadata:** Define key details such as the metric’s description, numerator, denominator, and other relevant specifications. Each KRI must have a unique identifier that follows the existing naming convention (e.g., `kri0013` for `{gsm.kri}` or `kri0002ep` for `{gsm.endpoints}`).
- **Metric Data Specification:** Ensure the data specifications align with updates made to the data model. This step guarantees consistency in data interpretation and calculation.
- **Metric Workflow Definition:** Specify the functions and parameters required to calculate the metric. This typically follows the standard GSM analysis workflow, ensuring consistency with existing metrics.

#### Creating Country-Level Workflows (If Applicable)
If country-level metrics are needed, parallel workflows must be created within the `{gsm.kri}` package. These workflows allow for localized risk assessment and reporting, providing granularity in data analysis.

#### Updating Core Analytical Functions
The next step involves updating `{gsm.core}` analytics functions to ensure they can accurately compute the new KRI. This may include modifying existing logic, incorporating additional parameters, or adjusting calculations to reflect the new metric’s requirements. This step may not be necessary for every new metric.

#### Enhancing Visualization and Reporting Functionality
Finally, any necessary updates should be made to the `{gsm.kri}` and `{rbm-viz}` packages to support visualization and widget functionality. This ensures that the new KRI is correctly represented in dashboards and reports, providing clear and actionable insights for stakeholders. This step may not be necessary for every new metric.

By following these steps, we ensure that the new metric is seamlessly integrated into our analytics framework, maintaining consistency, accuracy, and usability across the system.

#### Add qualification test(s) 

To ensure that the metric is behaving as expected for test data, a new test or multiple tests must be written and documented in the
`{gsm.qc}` package. `{gsm.qc}` uses the `{qcthat}` framework, which is detailed in the package documentation [here](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/).


### Steps to Incorporate a Metric into Reporting Outputs
Once the new Key Risk Indicator (KRI) has been integrated into the analytics framework, it must be incorporated into reporting outputs to ensure visibility and usability. This process involves updating existing reports or creating new ones and integrating the metric into the application specified in `{gsm.app}`.

#### Adding New Metric(s) to Reports
- **Integrate into Existing Reports:** If the new metric aligns with the structure of current KRI reports, add it to the appropriate reports to maintain consistency in analysis and visualization.
- **Create a New Report (If Needed):** If the new metric requires unique data representation or analysis, develop a standalone report tailored to its specifications. This ensures that the metric is properly contextualized for stakeholders.

#### Updating the Application for Metric Integration
- **Add the Metric to {gsm.app}:** If the metric follows standard KRI functionality, integrate it into the existing application as a standard KRI. This ensures that it is accessible and consistent with other KRIs.
- **Develop a New Module (If Required):** If the metric requires specialized functionality beyond the existing KRI framework, create a new module within {gsm.app} to support its unique requirements. This may involve custom visualizations, interactions, or calculations specific to the new metric.
  
#### Generate Risk signals for `{grail}`
In order to incorporate this metric into the ticketing system used by the risk advisers to address flagged sites or participaants, `{grail}` must be updated to add default actions for risk signals produced by this metric. 

#### Update Study scripts to add the metrics
To ensure that the new Key Risk Indicator (KRI) is correctly integrated into ongoing studies, we must update existing study scripts. These scripts are responsible for processing study-level data, generating risk signals, and ensuring that the new metric is included in all relevant analyses.

Review the current study scripts to determine which ones require modifications to accommodate the new metric.
Identify any dependencies or interactions between the new metric and existing KRIs, ensuring that all calculations remain consistent, and the Priority tag in the `meta` yamls are appropriately assigned.

By following these steps, we ensure that the new KRI is effectively incorporated into reporting modules and applications, enabling the study team to monitor and evaluate the metric for a given study.
